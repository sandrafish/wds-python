# Intro to Python Women's Data Science Study Group

These files are set up with Python 3.7 and Jupyter notebook using pipenv, which creates a closed environment that doesn't interfere with other programs.

To replicate on your computer, you may download this repo. Or install [Python](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/prerequisites/python.html) if you don't have it already, and [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) from the command line.

## Resources, etc.

Some general concepts:
* #document your code
* Google is your friend when you get those error messages
* [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) can be super helpful too
* Expect to make mistakes - typing correctly 100% is impossible and many errors are misspelled words, missing commas, wrong indentation
* Search github 
* Ask for help on the slack channel
* Check out [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/). It has great tutorials and recommendations.
* Practice. Try [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) or the Py app for your phone.
* Work on a project. Start with something simple, like a program to download and open a file.
* Ben Welsh has [great Django](http://first-django-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [data journalism](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/) tutorials online.
